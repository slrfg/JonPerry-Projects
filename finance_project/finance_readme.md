Personal Finance made easy!

CREATING AN ACCOUNT:

When you start the program , you will be prompted to create a distinct User name.

Next, you will be prompted to choose the type of account you are creating:

1. Savings
2. Personal Checking
3. Business Checking (you may create multiple business accounts).

Finally, you will enter the amount of the initial funds deposited in the account.



RECORDING CHECKING TRANSACTIONS:

Each time you enter a new checking transaction, you will be asked to enter:
- the amount paid
- the category of payment
- the name of the Payee


RECORDING SAVINGS TRANSACTIONS:

Each time you enter a new savings transaction, you will be asked to enter:
- the amount of the deposit
- the source of the funds (cash/check issuer)

The Time and Date of each new transactions is automatically saved to the account, making it easy to review
the account history or to change information for previously recorded transactions.

Although you are encouraged to record all the information requested, only the Amount is required.
If you are missing a requested piece of information, simply hit the RETURN key to skip that field.
